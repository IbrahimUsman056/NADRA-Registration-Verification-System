The National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) of Pakistan plans to develop a centralized Registration and Verification System using ASP.NET Core Web API and Entity Framework Core.
Currently, different departments such as Union Councils, Banks, Police, and other government institutions maintain partial or duplicate citizen records. This results in data inconsistency, delayed verification, and security risks.
The proposed system will serve as a centralized, secure Web API that authorized departments can use to verify, register, and request updates to citizen information in real time.
